    \begin{itemize}
        \item Global Memory: High-latency. Increase arithmetic in the program is to reduce accesses to global memory. All threads can access to it.
        \item Constant Memory: Short-latency. Total of 64KB on CUDA devices. Memory is cached. \texttt{\_\_constant\_\_} keyword is used to declare variables in this memory.
        \item Registers: On-chip memories. High-speed and concurrent. Kernel would store variables private to a thread into registers. SM 2.0 supports 63 registers while SM 3.5 expands to 255 registers.
        \item Shared Memory: Can be used to inter-thread communication. For accessing shared memory, processor needs to do a LOAD operation (registers do not require this).
